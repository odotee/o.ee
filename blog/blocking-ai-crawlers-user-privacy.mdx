We have implemented a new measure across our platforms - **C.IM**, **P.LU**, **R.NF**, and **Image.Hosting** - to **block AI crawlers** from scraping user-generated content.

Our goal is simple: **protect your privacy and respect your copyright**.  

Your posts, videos, and uploads belong to you - not to corporations harvesting content to train AI models.

## üîí What Have We Done?

We‚Äôve enabled **Cloudflare‚Äôs [‚ÄúControl AI Crawlers‚Äù](https://blog.cloudflare.com/control-content-use-for-ai-training/) protection**, as documented here:  

üîó [Cloudflare: Bot and AI crawler protection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot/#ai-bots)

This currently blocks known AI bots from major tech companies, including:

- GPTBot (OpenAI)
- ClaudeBot (Anthropic)
- GoogleOther & Google-CloudVertexBot (Google)
- Meta-ExternalAgent (Meta)
- Amazonbot (Amazon)
- Applebot (Apple)
- Bytespider & TikTokSpider (ByteDance)
- PetalBot (Huawei)
- CCBot (Common Crawl)
- DuckAssistBot (DuckDuckGo)

This list may grow over time as new bots are identified.
