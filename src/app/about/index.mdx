# About Us

**Owl Owl OÜ** is an Estonia-based company building privacy-first, decentralized internet services.

We believe in a more open and user-respecting web — one without intrusive ads, opaque algorithms, or centralized gatekeepers. Our platforms are powered by open-source software and federated protocols like ActivityPub, making them part of the growing, diverse Fediverse.

### What We Operate

We currently maintain and support:

- [C.IM](https://c.im) — a Mastodon instance for open social networking
- [P.LU](https://p.lu) — a PeerTube platform for decentralized video hosting
- [R.NF](https://r.nf) — a Lemmy instance for link-sharing and community discussion
- [Image.Hosting](https://image.hosting) — a clean, fast image hosting service

Our services are independently funded, hosted in the European Union, and guided by strong privacy ethics.

### Our Values

- **Openness** — Open-source software, transparent rules, and accessible tools  
- **Privacy** — No tracking, no profiling, and GDPR-compliant data handling  
- **Decentralization** — We support federated technologies that reduce platform lock-in

> We’re here to help build the internet we want to use — one that puts people first.
